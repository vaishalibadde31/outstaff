# Candidate Assignment: OutStaff Enhancements

## Goal
Assess your ability to understand an existing Flask + Tailwind web application (OutStaff), navigate it end-to-end, and deliver business-focused enhancements with clear UX intent.

## What to do
1) **Get it running**: Start the app locally, confirm you can reach the UI, and verify core flows work.  
2) **Baseline flows**: Register a user, log in, and create an organization to demonstrate you understand the current experience.  
3) **Navigation redesign**: Replace the current top navbar with a left sidebar that cleanly lists all primary destinations (e.g., Dashboard, Organizations, Certificates, Time Tracking, Admin, etc.). Aim for clarity, consistency, and a cohesive light/green theme.  
4) **New Scheduling module**: Add a “Shift Scheduling” area focused on business needs:
   - Business ask: Managers should be able to plan shifts for team members, see coverage, and avoid conflicts.  
   - Must-haves: views for upcoming shifts, the ability to assign people to shifts, a way to spot/handle overlapping shifts, and a simple status indicator (draft/published).  
   - Nice-to-haves: filters by date/role/user, and a high-level coverage summary.  
   - Keep it consistent with the rest of OutStaff’s look and role-based access expectations (admins manage schedules, members view their shifts).  

## Deliverables
- Updated UI with sidebar navigation applied across the app.
- Shift Scheduling section visible in the sidebar with pages/screens that meet the business needs above.
- Brief notes on how you ran the app, validated the baseline flows, and what assumptions you made.

## Guidance
- Think in terms of business outcomes: clarity for admins and ease-of-use for members.  
- Favor intentional layout and readable copy over heavy styling.  
- Keep scope realistic but complete enough to demonstrate your product thinking and execution.
